# Title of Data Science project:Predicting-welfare-assistance-with-Random-Forest
Description: Costa-Rican household poverty level prediction. The problem which I am trying to solve is: " Can you identify which households need welfare assistance based on their features which are visible in the database?
Usage of the project: Goverment institution( Central or Local) can use the Machine Learning algorithm to identify which families deserve to be on welfare assistance(in this way welfare will be distributed in an unbiased way).
General notes: During this project, I was cautious not to include all the features available of the dataset,as many of the features are correlated with each-other. I used 26 out 90 features and this gave me a RF algorithm which has good predicting power on previously unseen data.
